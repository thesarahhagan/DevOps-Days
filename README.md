# You're so empathetic, you probably know this talk's not about you.
Accompanying repository for the DevOps Days [Seattle](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-seattle/welcome/) and [Silicon Valley](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2018-silicon-valley/welcome/) conferences.

# Abstract
We know DevOps culture requires increased collaboration between teams to move faster and be more agile. But what do you do when you’re forced to work with someone who just doesn’t get it, and how do you get to a place where work can happen seamlessly? This talk uses empirical research and practical tips to tell you how to learn more about yourself, understand the perspective of others, and bring empathy into your daily work.

### Personality Assessments
* **[Clifton Strengths](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Purchase/en-US/ProductDetails/10108/top-5-cliftonstrengths-access)**   
  Pay $20 to take a 10-minute forced-choice self-report measure that will give you your top 5 strengths out of 34. Sometimes called <i>talent themes</i>, each of the [strengths](https://www.gallupstrengthscenter.com/Home/en-US/CliftonStrengths-Themes-Domains) falls under a theme: executing, strategic thinking, influencing, or relationship-building. 
* **A [free DISC assessment](https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc/)**   
  Free assessment (this usually costs money, so this is a great resource!) to help you better understand your personality and behavioral styles. This 10-minute survey will ask you questions that will determine whether you're task-focused, people-focused, passive, or active. _I do not endorse the views of this particular consultant, but the test is psychometrically valid and will provide a free report regardless of the validity of the email address you use._
* **The [IPIP-NEO long and short versions](http://www.personal.psu.edu/~j5j/IPIP/)**  
  A free personality test that measures the Big Five personality traits (note this is not the version of the test that is used by clinicians, but it's a version of something similar). Pros: It's free! Cons: It's not the best user experience, and also you have to copy/paste your results somewhere to save it (instead of a nice printed PDF like the two above).
